**Dify** is an easy-to-use LLMOps platform designed to empower more people to create sustainable, AI-native applications. With visual orchestration for various application types, Dify offers out-of-the-box, ready-to-use applications that can also serve as Backend-as-a-Service APIs. Unify your development process with one API for plugins and datasets integration, and streamline your operations using a single interface for prompt engineering, visual analytics, and continuous improvement.


## Use Cloud Services

## Install the Community Edition

Our Community Edition is in preparation and is expected to be released on GitHub within 2 weeks. You can star this project in advance.

---

Applications created with Dify include:

Out-of-the-box web sites supporting form mode and chat conversation mode
A single API encompassing plugin capabilities, context enhancement, and more, saving you backend coding effort
Visual data analysis, log review, and annotation for applications
Dify is compatible with Langchain, meaning we'll gradually support multiple LLMs, currently supported:

- GPT 3 (text-davinci-003)
- GPT 3.5 Turbo(ChatGPT)
- GPT-4

## Roadmap

Features under development:

Datasets, embedding your own data into AI applications, including text, webpages, and even Notion content
Plugins, introducing ChatGPT Plugin-standard plugins for applications, or using Dify-produced plugins


## Q&A

**Q: What can I do with Dify?**

A: Dify is a simple yet powerful LLM development and operations tool. You can use it to build commercial-grade applications, personal assistants. If you want to develop your own applications, LangDifyGenius can save you backend work in integrating with OpenAI and offer visual operations capabilities, allowing you to continuously improve and train your GPT model.

**Q: How do I use Dify to "train" my own model?**

A: A valuable application consists of Prompt Engineering, context enhancement, and Fine-tuning. We've created a hybrid programming approach combining Prompts with programming languages (similar to a template engine), making it easy to accomplish long-text embedding or capturing subtitles from a user-input Youtube video - all of which will be submitted as context for LLMs to process. We place great emphasis on application operability, with data generated by users during App usage available for analysis, annotation, and continuous training. Without the right tools, these steps can be time-consuming.

**Q: What do I need to prepare if I want to create my own application?**

A: We assume you already have an OpenAI API Key; if not, please register for one. If you already have some content that can serve as training context, that's great!

**Q: What interface languages are available?**

A: English and Chinese are currently supported, and you can contribute language packs to us.

## About Us

The Dify project was created by former members of the Tencent Cloud DevOps team. We found that developing GPT applications based on OpenAI APIs was somewhat cumbersome. Leveraging our years of experience in developing developer efficiency tools, we hope to enable more people to create interesting apps through natural language.
